First, there's the inventory feature, which allows users to add their clothing items, plan outfits, and categorize them into different sections for a clear overview of their wardrobe.<br>The second functionality is designed to facilitate the buying and selling of second-hand clothing, both locally and nationally. Users can easily list items they no longer use for sale and browse through a wide selection of second-hand items to complement their current wardrobe.<br>With these features, the platform aims to encourage users to make conscious choices by maximizing the use of existing clothing resources and actively participating in the sustainable fashion movement.",
