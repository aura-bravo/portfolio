    "result": "We aimed to harness color as a storytelling element, intentionally utilizing it to differentiate the main sections. From carefully selecting color palettes and typography to developing flexible designs, our primary objective was to enhance legibility while emphasizing function, clarity, and simplicity. For that we created a digital component system capable of effectively supporting the museum's regular content, including exhibitions, events, educational programs, and more. Furthermore, we purposefully leverage the lightness of white space, enabling the design to breathe and ensuring that the works of art assumed the role of the true protagonists.",
